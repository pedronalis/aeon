# Sound Files

This directory should contain the completion sound file.

## Required File

- `complete.mp3` - Sound played when a focus session completes

## How to Add

You can:
1. Download a free sound from https://freesound.org/
2. Use any MP3 file (keep it short, ~1-2 seconds)
3. Generate one using online tools

The app will attempt to play `/sounds/complete.mp3` when a focus session completes.
If the file doesn't exist, the sound will simply be skipped (no error).

## Recommended Sounds

- Gentle bell/chime
- Soft notification tone
- Subtle "ding"

Keep volume at ~0.5 (50%) for a pleasant experience.
