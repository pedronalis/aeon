# Sound Files

This directory should contain the completion sound file.

## Required File

- `complete.wav` - Sound played when a focus session completes

## How to Replace

- Use any WAV file (keep it short, ~1-2 seconds)
- Replace `public/sounds/complete.wav`

The app will attempt to play `/sounds/complete.wav` when a focus session completes.
If the file doesn't exist, a fallback beep will be attempted.

## Recommended Sounds

- Gentle bell/chime
- Soft notification tone
- Subtle "ding"

Keep volume at ~0.5 (50%) for a pleasant experience.
